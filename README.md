# Stroke-Prediction

## Analyzing the Stroke Prediction Dataset using Feature Selection for Supervised Learning
### Made By: Katie Yang

***

**Project Overview**
*  The goal of this project is to attempt to predict the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on demographic and other health-related features.
*  I will be using feature selection techniques in order to identify the most relavant predictors and then apply classification models (logistic regression, random forest)
 *  **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* By finding the most important features, I hope to be able to create a more efficient model to predict the likelihood of experiencing a stroke
  *  **Goal:** Optimize prediction of stroke occurence and improve model performance through feature selection
